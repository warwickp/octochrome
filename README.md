# Octochrome

A Google Chrome extension that scratches my personal itches as a GitHub user.

### Usage

Install into Google Chrome, then set the Options by entering your GitHub username, token and the organization or user whose repos you want to use.

### What it does today

Nothing exceptional. It leverages the GitHub (deprecated, I know) API [V2](http://develop.github.com/) to extract a list of repositories from a user or organization and then display links to these repos in a little popup directly from my Chrome toolbar. 

It uses jQuery. And CSS. And monkeys.

It's uglier than anything you have ever seen.

### What it should do

It should use the V3 API.

It should show a lovely little table with quick links to Issues, Commits, Pull Requests and even show numbers of Forks and Watchers. Hell, it should DO SOMETHING USEFUL. And be sexier.

It will some day, I hope. That's where you come in.

### Credits

I perused and adapted things from [Susan Potter](https://github.com/mbbx6spp/github-chrome-extension). She rules.
